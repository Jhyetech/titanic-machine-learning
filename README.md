This project involved developing a machine learning model that can predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on their attributes such as age, gender, class, and fare. To achieve this, Python programming language was used along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

The project began by delving into the dataset, carrying out data cleaning, and visualizing the data to gain useful insights. Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours were then trained and evaluated to determine which model would be the most appropriate.

Based on the high accuracy and ability to handle non-linear relationships between the features, the Random Forest model was selected as the final model. This model was used to predict the survival of passengers in a separate test dataset, and the results were saved in a CSV file for submission.

This project showcases the step-by-step process of building a machine learning model, starting from data exploration, data cleaning, and visualization, to model selection, evaluation, and submission. It also highlights the significance of feature engineering and data preprocessing in enhancing the performance of the model.
